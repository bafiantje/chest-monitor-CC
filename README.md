# (live) Chest Monitor Computer Craft
Chest monitor for CraftOS v1.9 CC: Tweaked. 
For the technologically impaired players of minecraft that have no idea how to program in Lua. I was forced to upload this to my github by my college coaches.

<small>As you can see it is a very simple script and does not accumulatively sum up the glowstone, it rather shows you the slot that item is occupying and the count of the item in that slot</small>

## Features
This is the list of features and limitations of this CC(Computer Craft) program:

* it counts the amount of items occupying a slot.
* it is a live monitor and it updates after a few seconds (**not** instantly)
* It is stylized to the center of the monitor
* It does not support computers with multiple monitors attached to it (in the sense of having a monitor in its *front face*, *back face*, *left face*, *etc*).
* It does not support multiple chests.
