# (live) Chest Monitor Computer Craft
Chest monitor for CraftOS v1.9 CC: Tweaked. 
For the technologically impaired players of minecraft that have no idea how to program in Lua. I was forced to upload this to my github by my college coaches.

<small>As you can see it is a very simple script and does not accumulatively sum up the glowstone, it rather shows you the slot that item is occupying and the count of the item in that slot</small>

## Features
This is the list of features and limitations of this CC(Computer Craft) program:

* it counts the amount of items occupying a slot.
* it is a live monitor and it updates after a few seconds (**not** instantly)
* It is stylized to the center of the monitor
* It does not support computers with multiple monitors attached to it (in the sense of having a monitor in its *front face*, *back face*, *left face*, *etc*).
* It does not support multiple chests.
* ~~Has a way to stop the script at will~~ deprecated, because there already is a way to terminate a script built-in CC: Tweaked (oversight).

## Installation
Here is a step by step guide on how to install this to your computercraft device!
1. Make sure you're playing in a modpack with CC: Tweaked or said mod standalone.
2. Make sure you have a monitor hooked up to the computer (its size does not matter, but I recommend a 4 x 4, 16 block, monitor)
3. Make sure you have a chest hooked up to the computer
4. Open the computer terminal and run `wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bafiantje/chest-monitor-CC/main/install.lua`. This will download the `chest_monitor.lua` file.
5. This step would also be mentioned in the terminal but run `reboot` to start the program.
